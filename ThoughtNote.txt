capstone project - frontend development


                              ---- This is a descriptive note of my work----


--- i started with creating the complete folder structure.
--- created five folder named men, women, kids, images and common.
--- in common folder, there's 4 files named footer.html, header.html, script.js and style.css.
--- each men, women, kids have 5 files named allproducts, indianwear, westernwear, sportswear
    and sleep&lounge wear.
--- besides these there's allproducts.html, cart.html, contact.html, decor.html, index.html
    and login.html.
--- then added neccessary cdn links to all the pages namely bootstrap css and js cdn links.
    jquery and fontawesome cdn links as well.    
--- after creating folders, i created header and footer.
--- and then dynamically added these to all the pages mentioned above.
--- i used jquery to complete this task.
--- all the javascript and jquery code is in external script.js javascript file and this is
    linked to all of the pages.
--- i made sure not to include bootstrap and jquery js cdn links to header and footer to
    avoid duplication of links and prevented toogler issue that arises from this.
--- all the css is in single style.css file.
--- css has been used for hovering effects, customized color of font, carousel indicators
    and background color. 
--- for almost every styling, i try to rely on bootstrap only.
--- all the webpages are fully responsive. 
--- all the webpages are properly commented for ease of understanding to me aswell as to
    reviewer.

                                        ---- extra----

--- have added extra button in navbar with dropdown option as dark mode and light mode.
--- using this button, user can switch to dark mode and light mode as per their convenience.
--- there is an extra button named wishlist in navbar which is also connected to cart.html
--- there's scrolling text that i have included in navbar to make it look more proffessional
    and dynamic.
--- to achieve this goal of mine i used <marquee> tag of html.
--- added favicons to all the webpages which i created myself on canva.
--- have created an upicon whose position has been fixed at the bottom of the page so user
    always have an access to it and can used it move to top of the page.
--- have changed it's size for different devices and has hovering effect on it.
    on hovering on this upicon, color and size changes for better user experience.
--- with that it has a color that goes well with my webapp color scheme.



--- index.html


   - this webpage consist of header, main and footer section like every other webpage. 
   - after header comes carousel.
   - the carousel i have used is first user interaction autoplay carousel. 
   - first slide consist of company logo and slogan which i have built on canva myself and
     wrote my tagline myself.
   - as this is a clothing eccomerce platform so i named it "styleup" and my company's
     slogan is "we know you want to.".
   - so, in carousel i have customized carousel indicators and made it " #shopnow ".
   - to fulfil this purpose i used font awesome.
   - i have also customized next and previous icon all the carousels used in this projects.
   - to match it with color scheme that i have selected which is lavender.
   - after this, comes another carousel which consist of circular images.
   - then comes featured products section which consist of further three sub categories named
     women's , men's and kid's. 
   - here in this carousel i have cards included which has hovering effect on it.
   - on hovering on these cards comes up the description of the products including price
     of products and heart icon(add to wishlist option).
   - these carousels are also fully responsive. i have made it seperately for large screens,
     medium screens and small screens to make that possible. 
   - after these three women's, men's and kid's carousel sections comes shop by section.
   - this section is further divided into four namely shop by size, shop by brand,
     shop by occasion and shop by category.

     - shop by size
       - here i have created animation. created my own images using canva.
       - to make it fully responsive i have wrote media query and this couldn't be achieved
         with bootstrap and css only.
       - for background, i have used linear gradient property only.      

     - shop by brand
       - here i have marquee tag of HTML to make my brands name scroll and give a proffessional
         look to my webpage.
       - there's some 50 brand logo i have added for better visualization.    

     - shop by occasion
       - then comes shop by occasion, which is dedicated to festivals.
       - have added images in this section. used bootstrap grid only to make it responsive.    

     - shop by category
       - this includes images related to different moods. 
       - responsive.

   - express shiping
     - this contains an image and text.
     - i have added animation on title to make it look interactive.

   - style up carousel
    - this is more like a informative block which tells user that styleup does not
      conduct any competition and do not ask for bank details.
    - the pupose to add this section is to make it look realistic.     
    - this is as well fully responsive.

   - there is one submit button along with input fields.
   - there's three input field name, email address and message.
   - fully responsive
  

--- login.html


   - created login page using bootstrap only.
   - used bootstrap input form to achieve this.
   - used modal here for different possibilities.
   - for instance, when user click on login button without entering credentials. 
     modal popup saying you forgot to enter credentials
   - and when user enter admin@admin.com as email id and 123456 as password then modal pops up saying
     congratulations , you have succesfully logged in.
   - and then comes 3rd possibilities, where if user have entered something else than email id and password that
     has been set then modal pops up saying warning , invalid email or password. 
   - for all these three modals, i have added three different images to make it look more lively.
   - there is hovering effect added on login block.
   - modal is set to the center of the page.
   - fully responsive
  


--- cart.html


   - in cart i have created two columns one takes 8 column and another takes 4 columns.
   - again this is responsive and i have tailored it for different devices.
   - so in first column, there's further division into three columns .
   - first one contains an image, second one contains description about item that has been
     added to cart with delete button.
   - In the third column, there's two font awesome icons " + " and " - " and one input field with value 
     set between them.
   - After this, in second column there's complete description related to price breakoff of item and checkout button.
   - And after this, there comes an image which is placed in the center and has img-fluid applied to it.
